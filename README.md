# Kaggle projects 

This repository contains all the code I wrote for Kaggle competition. 

## Topics modeling with gensim
This is a response to this Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/kernels).
The objective was to predict if questions were sincere or insincere. 
I chose to focus on topic modeling before working more on the machine learning itself.
